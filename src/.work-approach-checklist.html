<h1>Work approach checklist</h1>

<p>
    The following constitutes the checklist that should become the natural way
    to resolve issues. It is intended to be exhaustive, so as to cover each base.
</p>
<p>
    It should be noted that often not all steps are applicable for successfully
    resolving a ticket. If so, the respective steps can quickly be checked off
    as N/A. It should also be noted that the list is not intended to be written
    out in such detail that it becomes obstructive of the actual implementation
    process by taking too much time. The list is intended, however, to serve as
    a guideline for what in due time should become the natural approach to
    resolve    tickets.
</p>

<p>
    The following Team Members are recognized in this process:
</p>

<ul class="role-legend">
    <li class="role role-end-user">End User</li>
    <li class="role role-stakeholder">Stakeholder</li>
    <li class="role role-product-owner">Product Owner</li>
    <li class="role role-scrum-master">Scrum Master</li>
    <li class="role role-quality-assurance">Quality Assurance</li>
    <li class="role role-developer">Developer
      <ul>
        <li class="role role-ux">User eXperience </li>
        <li class="role role-graphic-designer">Graphic Designer </li>
        <li class="role role-programmer">Programmer</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For each step a single role/person is respionsible (optionally assisted by
  Scrum Master or QA)

  </h2>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <li>
    <strong>Is the IDEA clear enough to create an IDEA ticket?</strong>
    <p>
      When an <span class="role role-end-user">End User</span> or stakeholder has the idea that something shold be changed
      or added to the system, it should be clear what problem the idea addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The product owner should be able to summarize the goal should in one or
      two sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any relevant information should be gathered together in an IDEA ticket.The
      content of the ticket should be clear, without explaning it in person. This
      can be validated with the Scrum Master. Once the ticket is clear it should
      be validated by the stake-holder to make sure the ticket represents their
      reality.

  </li>
  <!-- ===================================================================== -->
  <li>
    <strong>What is the impact of the idea on the business?</strong>
    <p>
      The product owner should be able to asses what the idea will cost in terms
      of investement (time, resources, money) and how the idea will improve the
      business value of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      High-level estimates should be provided to indicate what the financial
      value of the idea is expected to be. What are the implementation costs?
      How many hours will the idea take to implement? For which year are these
      changes budgeted? What are these figures based upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      It should also be noted if the idea will impact Key Performance Indicators
      (KPI). I.e. how will this help the business in achieving their objectives
      and reaching their targets.

    <strong>What is the impact of the idea on the current system?</strong>
    <p>
      If the idea is user-facing, how will the user be impacted? Does it pertain
      to Consumers, Dealers, Employees? Does the UI have to be changed? Will import
      have an impact on the user experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      If the idea is mostly machine facing, how does it impact the existing stack?
      Will systems communictaion be influenced? Do API need to change?

      <li>Which processes are involved?</li>

      Which area's within the business are involved? Are there departements that
      need to be informed or collaborated with?

  <li>
    <strong>Is enough information present to create a PROPOSAL ticket?</strong>
    <p>
      Can all relevant fields be filled in, based on the information gather up
      until now? If not, more clarity is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all of the information has been placed in an issue, it should be
      checked with the stakeholders to manage their expectations and validate
      that their idea and the proposal match.

<!-- ====================================================================== -->
  <li>
    <strong>Are all of the specifications clear?</strong>
    <p>
      In order to clearly communicate which changes need to be made to the
      existing applications in order to successfuly implement the proposal,
      specifications need to be created.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various tools available to make matters more clear. Depending on
      the subject, one or more of the following can be used to paint a clear
      picture:

      Instead of creating these deliverables themselves, a product owner can
      delegate tasks to the development team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually Acceptance Criteria should be apparent. This includes both
      Success Scenario's for when the process flow goes as planned as well as
      Failure Scenario's for when reality deviates from the desired flow.

      Once all of the specifications are clear and can be understood by the team,
      the relevant information should be added to a project ticket so work on
      the issue can start.
